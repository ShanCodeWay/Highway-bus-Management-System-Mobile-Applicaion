# Introduction

Passengers can use the High-Way Bus Management System mobile app to view bus schedules, availability, delays, ticket prices, live locations, lost and found item details, and ticket and luggage reservations.

To book a ticket, passengers must first select their destination, start time, and end time from the drop-down menus. The system will then display all bus schedules that match the selected criteria. Each bus schedule will have a booking button. Passengers can click on the booking button to reserve a ticket.

Before booking a ticket, passengers must log in or sign up. If the signup is successful, a verification email will be sent to the passenger's email address.
